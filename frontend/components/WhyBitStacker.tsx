          By utilizing the best features of Ethereum Smart Contracts we have
          created an innovative concept in Cloud Mining services called
          BitStacker. It is a collection of NFTs split into 2 tiers â€“ & These
          tiers grant the holder a perpetual ownership of fractionalized
          hashpower generated by physical Bitcoin mining machines with up to
          40,000 Th/s of distributable hashrate. Proceeds from the sales will be
          directly used to purchase & setup the miners as well as cover all the
          associated operating costs. These miners will be professionally
          installed in various commercially viable facilities and operated
          24/7/365 by an experienced team of technicians. Once the mining farm
          is up and running, our team of specialized technicians will manage &
          maintain the miners at optimal efficiency levels, giving you the
          highest returns possible without sacrificing its functionality &
          lifespan. This will ensure the holders receive a guaranteed monthly
          reward in Bitcoin.
